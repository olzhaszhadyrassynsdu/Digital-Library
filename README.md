Subscription works in this way: 
  When a periodical arrives to the company, it goes to the library where it is registered;
  The librarian attaches a list of the subscribers to it, and sends it to the first employee on the list;
  The internal snail-mail service is used for the physical transport;
  The employee is supposed to read it within three work days, sign off on the list with name and date, and send it to the next employee on the list;
  When the last employee on the list has read it, he returns it to the library, where it becomes available for common use
